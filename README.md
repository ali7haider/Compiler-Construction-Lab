# Compiler Construction Lab - Fall 2024

## Brief Description
This repository contains the code and assignments developed during the **Compiler Construction Lab** taught by **Sir Laeeq** in the Fall 2024 semester. The focus is on the design and implementation of compilers, covering topics such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation.

## Long Description
The **Compiler Construction Lab** is part of the course offered in Fall 2024 under the guidance of **Sir Laeeq**. The lab exercises delve into various phases of the compiler design process, aiming to give students a hands-on understanding of how a high-level programming language is translated into machine code.

### Topics Covered:
1. **Lexical Analysis**:
   - Tokenizing source code into meaningful lexemes.
   - Implementing a lexer to scan and categorize code.
2. **Syntax Analysis**:
   - Building parsers to check the grammatical structure of the code.
   - Using parsing techniques like LL(1) and LR parsing.


The lab is designed to complement the theoretical concepts taught in the lecture, allowing students to implement various components of a compiler and see the practical application of compiler design principles.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **C++** for implementing various components like lexer, parser, etc.
- **Flex** for lexical and syntax analysis.

### Assignments and Projects:
This repository will contain:
- Assignments related to building different phases of a compiler.

Stay tuned for updates as the course progresses.
